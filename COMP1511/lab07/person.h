// This typedef declares that the type "Person" is the same as the type
// "pointer to struct person".
//
// The actual definition of "struct person" is not in person.h (this
// file), it's in person.c
//
// This means that you cannot directly access any of the fields of the
// person struct -- e.g. "person->name" is *invalid*.
typedef struct person *Person;

// Create a person and return a pointer to them
Person create_person(char name[MAX_NAME_LENGTH]);

// Free person frees any memory used for a person
void free_person(Person hero);

// give_power will add a power to a person
// It will add the string to the array of strings
// called powers if the person still has
// space to add powers
void give_power(char power[MAX_POWER_LENGTH], Person hero);

// Displays a person's information
void display_person(Person hero);
